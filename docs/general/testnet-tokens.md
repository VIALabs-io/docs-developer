# Testnet Tokens

To test VIA Labs' cross-chain functionality, you'll need testnet tokens for the blockchains you want to work with. This guide provides resources for obtaining testnet tokens on various supported networks.

## Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble obtaining testnet tokens:

1. **Rate Limits**: Many faucets have rate limits. If one faucet doesn't work, try another or wait a few hours.
2. **Social Media Verification**: Some faucets require social media verification. Make sure you have a Twitter/X account or GitHub account if needed.
3. **Discord Communities**: Join the respective blockchain's Discord community. Many have dedicated faucet channels where you can request tokens.
4. **VIA Labs Discord**: If you're still having trouble, join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/vialabs) and ask for help in the developer support channel.

## Next Steps

Once you have your testnet tokens, you're ready to start building cross-chain applications with VIA Labs. Check out our [examples](/examples/crosschain-token) to get started.
