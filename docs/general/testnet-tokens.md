# Testnet Tokens

When developing and testing cross-chain applications with VIA Labs, you'll need testnet tokens for gas fees to deploy and interact with your contracts.

:::info
ðŸ“˜ All fees for cross-chain messaging are turned off on testnets. You only need native tokens for gas to deploy and interact with your contracts.

## Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble obtaining testnet tokens:

1. **Rate Limits**: Most faucets have rate limits. Try different faucets or wait 24 hours before requesting again.
2. **Social Authentication**: Some faucets require Twitter/GitHub authentication to prevent abuse.
3. **Community Resources**: Join the [VIA Labs Discord](https://discord.gg/vialabs) to request testnet tokens from the community.
4. **Alternative Networks**: If one testnet is congested or faucets are depleted, consider using an alternative testnet from our [supported networks](/general/supported-networks).

## Next Steps

Once you have your testnet tokens, you're ready to start developing with VIA Labs. Check out our examples:
