# Bridged USDC Standard Onboarding

VIA Labs supports Circle's Bridged USDC Standard by offering a full onboarding program into the standard. Upon integration, the Bridged USDC Standard serves as a 1:1 USDC-backed stablecoin on a blockchain network.

Following the standard provides Circle with a path to upgrade to native USDC and enable deeper ecosystem interactions and opportunities.

## Benefits of the Standard

- **Backed 1:1 to USDC**: Ensures stability and trust in the token
- **Path to native USDC issuance**: Creates a clear upgrade path to official Circle-issued USDC

## Onboarding Process

1. **Submit a request** to integrate your blockchain with the VIA Network.
2. **VIA Labs deploys and verifies** the Bridged USDC Standard smart contracts.
3. **Additional confirmation from Circle** of all deployed Bridged USDC Standard smart contracts.
4. **Receive a comprehensive post-deployment summary** of all contracts and a bridging guide.
5. **Get a customized USDC bridging page** tailored for your blockchain.
6. **Access to [Proto-USD](/general/proto-usd)** - Get all the benefits of CCTP immediately upon deployment of the Bridged USDC Standard.

## The Role of VIA Labs

VIA Labs facilitates the onboarding process by:

- **Deploying the contracts**: Setting up the necessary infrastructure
- **Working hand-in-hand with Circle**: Verifying the authenticity and upgradability of the deployed Bridged USDC Standard
- **Seamlessly transferring the deployed contracts**: Ensuring smooth integration with the blockchain
- **Introducing the newly onboarded blockchain to Circle**: Facilitating marketing and public outreach
